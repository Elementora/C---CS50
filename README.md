# 🎓 CS50 C Programming Journey

This repository contains my **learning progress** in C programming as part of Harvard's **CS50** course. I'm documenting my exercises, challenges, and concepts I'm practicing while improving my understanding of C.

## 📂 Contents

This repository includes:

- Basic C programs (variables, conditions, loops)
- Problem-solving exercises (sorting, searching, memory management)
- CS50-specific challenges (Mario pyramid, credit card validator, population growth)

## 🚀 Running the Programs

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elementora/C---CS50.git
   cd C---CS50
   ```
2. **Compile a C program**:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```
3. **Run the compiled program**:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## 📖 My Learning Goals

- Understanding C basics and syntax ✅
- Practicing loops, conditions, and functions ✅
- Exploring data structures ⏳
- Learning memory management ⏳
- Working with file handling ❌

## 🏆 Why This Repository?

I'm using this repository to **track my learning progress** and store code for future reference. If you're also learning C, feel free to explore!
